## Introduction

<!-- TODO: check refs -->

A tool is only as good as one's ability to assess it. In human-computer interaction (HCI), evaluations usually rely on inquiries -- *e.g.*, questionnaires or think aloud protocol -- or on users' behavior during the interaction-- *e.g.*, reaction time or error rate. While both types of method have been used successfully for decades, they suffer from some limitation. Inquiries are prone to be contaminated by ambiguities or may be affected by social pressure. It is also very difficult to gain real-time insights without disrupting the interaction. Indeed, think aloud protocol distracts users and questionnaires can be given only at specific time points, usually at the end of a session -- which leads to a bias due to participants' memory limitations. Metrics inferred from behavioral measures, on the other hand, can be computed in real-time, but they are mostly quantitative. They do not provide much information about users' mental states. For example, a high reaction time can be caused either by a low concentration level or by a high cognitive workload.
