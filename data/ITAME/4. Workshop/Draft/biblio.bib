	between error processing and conscious self-monitoring of behavior,
	the present experiment examined whether an Ne and Pe are observed
	after response errors of which participants are unaware. Ne and Pe
	measures, behavioral accuracy, and trial-to-trial subjective accuracy
	judgments were obtained from participants performing an antisaccade
	task, which elicits many unperceived, incorrect reflex-like saccades.
	Consistent with previous research, subjectively unperceived saccade
	errors were almost always immediately corrected, and were associated
	with faster correction times and smaller saccade sizes than perceived
	errors. Importantly, irrespective of whether the participant was
	aware of the error or not, erroneous saccades were followed by a
	sizable Ne. In contrast, the Pe was much more pronounced for perceived
	than for unperceived errors. Unperceived errors were characterized
	by the absence of posterror slowing. These and other results are
	consistent with the view that the Ne and Pe reflect the activity
	of two separate error monitoring processes, of which only the later
	process, reflected by the Pe, is associated with conscious error
	recognition and remedial action.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are prone to errors in the recognition
	of subject's intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy
	of BCIs consists in a verification procedure directly based on the
	presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the electroencephalogram
	(EEG) recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Several studies
	show the presence of ErrP in typical choice reaction tasks. However,
	in the context of a BCI, the central question is: "Are ErrP also
	elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition
	of the subject's intent?"; We have thus explored whether ErrP also
	follow a feedback indicating incorrect responses of the simulated
	BCI interface. Five healthy volunteer subjects participated in a
	new human-robot interaction experiment, which seem to confirm the
	previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. However, in order
	to exploit these ErrP, we need to detect them in each single trial
	using a short window following the feedback associated to the response
	of the BCI. We have achieved an average recognition rate of correct
	and erroneous single trials of 83.5\% and 79.2\%, respectively, using
	a classifier built with data recorded up to three months earlier.},

@article{Fairclough2004,
abstract = {Previous studies have operationalised mental effort via various indices of psychophysiology, particularly cardiovascular measures. Metabolic measures represent a complementary approach wherein mental effort investment is explicitly linked to the process of energy mobilisation. The purpose of this study was to contrast cardiovascular variables (heart rate, 0.1 Hz component of heart rate variability) with a metabolic measure (blood glucose) of mental effort. Twenty-nine participants were exposed to Stroop stimuli over a 45 min period under two conditions: (a) congruent (i.e. 100\% congruent Stroop stimuli); and (b) incongruent (i.e. 100\% incongruent Stroop stimuli). Performance, blood glucose, cardiovascular activity and subjective mood were measured. The results indicated that blood glucose levels were sensitive to both Stroop and time-on-task variables, whilst cardiovascular measures were only sensitive to the latter. There was also evidence of an association between blood glucose levels and response accuracy. The implications of these findings for the operationalisation of mental effort are discussed.},

It was designed to investigate our ideas about how technologies for the home could support ludic activities-that is, activities motivated by curiosity, exploration, and reflection rather than externally-defined tasks. The many design choices we made, for example to block or disguise utilitarian functionality, helped to articulate our emerging understanding of ludic design. Observations of the Drift Table being used in volunteers' homes over several weeks gave greater insight into how playful exploration is practically achieved and the issues involved in designing for ludic engagement.}},

@inproceedings{deterding2011game,
    abstract = {{Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.}},
